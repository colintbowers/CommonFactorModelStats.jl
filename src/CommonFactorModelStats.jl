    - Estimating the number of factors using the methods from Bai, Ng (2002) Determining the Number
    of Factors in Approximate Factor Models
    - Testing whether an observed factor spans the latent common factor space using the methods
    from Bai, Ng (2006) Evaluating Latent and Observed Factors in Macroeconomics and Finance
